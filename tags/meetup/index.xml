      <description>Finally, the summary of our catchup
For those who have missed the last meet-up, the slides are here.
 Continuing the spirit of our previous meetup, there were three potential projects identified and discussed:
  Decentralised AI Practising a CNN implemenation on a cleansed Image Datasets (A Kaggle competition) Exploring Nottingham&amp;rsquo;s Open Datasets   Agreeing to the fact that Decentralised AI is a challenge that needs more focus and datasets, members were equally inclined in taking up both the other projects to &amp;lsquo;Practice what they&amp;rsquo;ve already learnt&amp;rsquo;/&amp;lsquo;Apply new techniques&amp;rsquo;/&amp;lsquo;Learn new aspects&amp;rsquo;.</description>
